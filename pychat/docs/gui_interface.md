## Implementation Details

The GUI is implemented using Python's Tkinter library, which is part of the standard library, making it easy to run on most platforms without additional dependencies.

Key components:
- `ChatWindow`: The main window containing the chat interface
- `LoginWindow`: Handles user authentication
- `RegistrationWindow`: Manages new user registration
- `GUIInterface`: Bridges between the interface and core components

## Running the GUI

To run the PyChat GUI:

```bash
# Method 1: Use the run_gui.py script
./run_gui.py

# Method 2: Run the module directly
python -m pychat.interfaces.gui_interface

# Method 3: Use the console script (if installed via pip)
pychat-gui
```
