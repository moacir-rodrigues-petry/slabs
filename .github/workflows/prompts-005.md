implement a github actions workflow for the tests

> Copilot: I'll help you implement a GitHub Actions workflow for running tests in this Python project. Let's create a workflow file that will run the tests whenever changes are pushed to the repository.
>
> First, let me explore the project structure a bit more to understand how the tests are run. Let me also check the requirements.txt file to understand the dependencies: Let me also look at the pytest.ini file: Now, let me check the setup.py file to understand how the package is structured: Now I'll create a GitHub Actions workflow file that will run the tests. Based on the project setup, I'll create a workflow that:
>
> 1. Sets up Python
> 2. Installs dependencies from requirements.txt
> 3. Runs the tests using pytest
> 4. Optionally uploads the test coverage report as an artifact
>
> Let's create the GitHub Actions workflow file: I've created a GitHub Actions workflow file at python-tests.yml. Here's what the workflow does:
>
> ### Workflow Structure
>
> 1. **Triggers**:
>
>    - Runs on push to main/master branches
>    - Runs on pull requests to main/master branches
>    - Can be manually triggered via the GitHub Actions UI
>
> 2. **Test Job**:
>
>    - Runs on multiple Python versions (3.9, 3.10, 3.11, and 3.13) to ensure compatibility
>    - Steps:
>      - Checkout the code
>      - Set up Python with dependency caching
>      - Install dependencies from requirements.txt
>      - Install the package itself
>      - Run tests with coverage
>      - Generate coverage reports
>      - Upload coverage reports as artifacts
>
> 3. **Coverage Job**:
>    - Only runs after the test job completes and only on direct pushes (not PRs)
>    - Generates a coverage report and uploads it to Codecov (a popular code coverage service)
>
> ### Benefits of This Workflow
>
> - **Matrix Testing**: Tests across multiple Python versions to ensure compatibility
> - **Dependency Caching**: Speeds up workflow runs by caching pip dependencies
> - **Coverage Reporting**: Generates and stores coverage reports
> - **Codecov Integration**: Ready to integrate with Codecov if you decide to use it
>
> ### Additional Notes
>
> - If you don't plan to use Codecov, you can remove the coverage job
> - You might want to update the branch names if your main branch has a different name
> - The workflow preserves coverage reports as artifacts for 7 days
>
> To start using this workflow:
>
> 1. The file is already created at python-tests.yml
> 2. Push this file to your GitHub repository
> 3. GitHub will automatically detect and run the workflow based on the configured triggers
>
> Would you like me to make any adjustments to this workflow?

update the failing job regard this: "The failing job encountered an error due to the use of a deprecated version of the actions/upload-artifact action (v3). As of April 16, 2024, this version is no longer supported, and the issue can be resolved by updating to a newer version of the action.

Solution:
Update the version of actions/upload-artifact: Modify your workflow file .github/workflows/python-tests.yml to use the latest version of actions/upload-artifact. Replace the deprecated v3 with the recommended version (e.g., v4 or the current latest version)."

> Copilot: I'll update the GitHub Actions workflow file to use the latest version of the `actions/upload-artifact` action. Let me first check the current content of the file to see what needs to be changed. Now I'll read the remaining part of the file to make sure I see everything: I need to update the following parts of the workflow file:
>
> 1. Change `actions/upload-artifact@v3` to `actions/upload-artifact@v4` in the test job
> 2. Also update `actions/checkout@v3` to `actions/checkout@v4` in the coverage job to ensure consistency
>
> Let's make these changes:
>
> ```
>
> ```
>
> ```
>
> ```
>
> I also notice the Codecov action might benefit from an update to be consistent with the other actions:
>
> ```
>
> ```
>
> I've updated your GitHub Actions workflow file with the following changes:
>
> 1. Updated `actions/upload-artifact` from v3 to v4 in the test job
> 2. Updated `actions/checkout` from v3 to v4 in the coverage job
> 3. Also updated `codecov/codecov-action` from v3 to v4 for consistency
>
> These updates ensure your workflow is using the latest supported versions of all GitHub Actions. The v3 version of the upload-artifact action was deprecated as of April 16, 2024, and the workflow should now use the recommended newer versions.
>
> This change should resolve the failing job error related to the deprecated action. The workflow will now use the current supported versions for all GitHub Actions components.

configure the gh actions to allow merge even if there are failed steps

> Copilot: I'll help you configure GitHub Actions to allow merges even if there are failed steps. This is typically done by adding a configuration to make the workflow's checks "soft-failed" or by using a status check that can pass even if individual steps fail.
>
> Looking at your current workflow, I'll add a configuration that allows the pull request to be merged even if the tests fail. This is usually done by configuring the repository settings rather than within the workflow itself, but we can add a specific job to always succeed and serve as the required status check.
>
> Let me update your GitHub Actions workflow:
>
> ```
>
> ```
>
> Now, let me also add a similar configuration to the coverage job:
>
> ```
>
> ```
>
> Finally, let's add a new job that will always succeed and can be used as the required status check for pull request merges:
>
> ```
>
> ```
>
> I've updated your GitHub Actions workflow to allow merging even if there are failed steps. Here are the changes I made:
>
> 1. **Added `continue-on-error: true` to the `test` job**:
>
>    - This setting allows the workflow to continue to the next job even if this job fails
>    - Tests will still run and report failures, but the overall workflow can proceed
>
> 2. **Added `continue-on-error: true` to the `coverage` job**:
>
>    - This ensures coverage reporting continues even if there are issues
>    - The job will be marked as successful in GitHub even if some steps fail
>
> 3. **Added a new `merge-check` job**:
>    - This job always runs (using `if: always()`) even if previous jobs fail
>    - It depends on the test job, so it will wait for tests to complete
>    - It contains a simple echo command that always succeeds
>    - This job can be used as the "required" status check for branch protection rules
>
> ### How to Use This Configuration
>
> With this configuration:
>
> 1. Tests will still run on every push and pull request
> 2. Failed tests will be visible in the GitHub UI
> 3. The `merge-check` job will always pass, allowing PRs to be merged
>
> ### Additional Repository Configuration
>
> For this to work fully with GitHub's branch protection rules, you should:
>
> 1. Go to your repository settings
> 2. Navigate to Branches â†’ Branch protection rules
> 3. Create or edit a rule for your main/master branch
> 4. Under "Require status checks to pass before merging"
> 5. Select the `merge-check` job as the required check
>
> This way, PRs can be merged as long as the tests have been run (regardless of whether they pass or fail), but you'll still have visibility into test failures.
>
> Would you like me to explain any part of this configuration in more detail?
